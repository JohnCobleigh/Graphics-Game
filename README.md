GitHub link is public, so you can clone the repo, and to look at it, you will need Godot, I use Godotv4.3 stable win64
To view animations, open the .exe file, or look through Godot
I’m not sure how this works on anything other than Windows, if it even works, the .exe file was created for Windows and not anything else
